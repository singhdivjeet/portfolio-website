        Hello Reader! I am Divjeet Singh Jas from Delhi, India. I am a master's student enrolled in the <a href="https://cs.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">computer science</a> program at the <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Davis</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prior to joining UC Davis, I have obtained my undergraduate degree from <a href="http://www.dtu.ac.in/Web/Departments/InformationTechnology/about/" target="_blank">Department of Information Technology</a>, <a href="http://dtu.ac.in/" target="_blank">Delhi Technological University</a>, Delhi, India, in 2020.
        My recent work experience has been at my startup, <a href="https://www.mushinlabs.com/" target="_blank">Mushin Innovation Labs Pvt. Ltd.</a> as a Chief Software Architect & Director, where I delivered 6 major projects within a year of taking charge. A part of my role was working with the Business Development team to establish the company’s portfolio, expanding the business verticals. I was also an integral part of the hiring and building of the company’s software team. Additionally, I managed a cross-platform team comprising of 6 frontend, backend, and cloud engineers. Furthermore, in my personal life, I enjoy a variety of activities like playing soccer, cycling, and most recently signed up to learn piano.
