        InCTF had both jeopardy style CTF and Attack-Defence style CTF. My team secured 14th rank out of 350+ teams (across India) in jeopardy style CTF and qualified for the finals which were held in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University. We secured 8th rank out of the 30 finalists in an attack-defense style CTF.
